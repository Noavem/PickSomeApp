# PickSomeApp
A Java application made with JavaFX using the RAWG and Gutendex REST APIs. Don't know what to play or read? Let PickSome suggest you something.

This application currently makes use of the RAWG API, but as this API seems to be in quite a dire state, I'll start making use of another API in the near future.

## Possible future updates
- More sophisticated history component
- The user being able to make and add to collections
- Filters being added to narrow suggestions
- Add movies and series to API selection
- Add more languages
